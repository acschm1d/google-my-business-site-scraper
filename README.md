# Google My Business Site Scraper

Due to the shutdown of Google My Business sites (https://support.google.com/business/answer/14368911?hl=de), this is a scraper to collect host and contact data of the affected site owners.

The original data comes from Sistrix (https://de.sistrix.com/business.site/seo/urls/mobile). Instead of a proper data export directly from Sistrix, HTML is parsed. This is done due to the credits that Sistrix requires for (JSON) downloads and the API restriction for non-professional packages. This method bypasses both restrictions.

The current data status is everything up to page 10, i.e. around 1,000 data records.
